    Software Engineer({\if\devops1{\textbf{DevOps/SRE}, \textbf{Go Developer}}\else{\textbf{Go Developer}, \textbf{DevOps/SRE}}\fi}) with \textbf{10+ years} of high expertise working with
        {\if\devops1{\textbf{Kubernetes}, \textbf{Go}}\else{\textbf{Go}, \textbf{Kubernetes}}\fi}, \textbf{AWS}, \textbf{Terraform}, \textbf{CI/CD} automation tools and \textbf{Microservices Architecture}.

    Keen on coming up with \textbf{design} solutions to make systems \textbf{reliable}, \textbf{fault-tolerant},
    and \textbf{as simple as possible} keeping \textbf{clean architecture} and clear \textbf{self-documented code}.

    Like automating development processes and daily routines to \textbf{save time} and \textbf{make the team's life easier}.

    Very impressed with the idea of cloud platforms, and I want to \textbf{contribute} to the \textbf{cloud domain} as a software engineer.

    I'd like to research how the things in a cloud are arranged on a low tier, and having extensive experience
    as a cloud consumer(\textbf{DevOps on AWS}) and being \textbf{an official contributor to Kubernetes(Go Developer)}
    I believe that my experience would be valuable at cloud team.
