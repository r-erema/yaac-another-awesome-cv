      The container-centric management software, has become the \textbf{de facto standard to deploy and operate containerized applications}.
      It's used by companies like \textbf{Google}, \textbf{Uber}, \textbf{Spotify}, \textbf{Salesforce}, etc. to manage their production workloads
      \begin{itemize}
        \item {\href{https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/110782}
        {Implemented OIDC Test Server and test coverage of the most critical OIDC cases}.
        OIDC Test Server allows contributors to \textbf{save time handling test cases} and \textbf{raise the quality of the K8S} in terms of OIDC}
        \item {\href{https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/aws-load-balancer-controller/pull/2735}
        {Resolved the issue of building listener rules based on ingress manifests for the AWS Load Balancer}}
        \item {\href{https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/110464}
        {Resolved the issue of premature deletion of uncompleted Kubernetes jobs}}
        \item {Created "1 click" automation to raise the development local cluster with the ability
        to debug(using GoLand by JetBrains) every single component of K8S - API Server, Controller Manager, Scheduler, and Kubelet,
          that saving time for the creation of the K8S infrastructure for convenient debugging of full data flow across each K8S component}
